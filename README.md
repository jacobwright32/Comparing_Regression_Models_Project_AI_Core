Linear Regression From Scratch
=======
Project Goal
---------------

The goal of this project was to create a basic linear regression model from scratch to understand the model in depth.

Data scraping:

    * Step 1: Load Data
      - Load in the dataset you want to try to model.
    
    * Step 2: Split The Data
      - Split the data into Features (X) and Labels (y).
      - X will take the shape M*N with M being the number of features your are using and N being the number of examples you have.
      - y will take the shape of 1xN with N being the number of examples you have. 
    
    * Step 3: Split the data again into Train, Validation and Test sets.
      - First split your data into Train and Test with 80% being the train data and 20% being the test data.
      - Then split your Train data again into Train and Validation sets with the same ratio as before (80/20).
    
    * Step 4: Normalisation or Standardisation
      - First calculate the Mean and the Standard Deviation (STD) of your Train dataset (Do Not Include Validation or Test Data!!!)
      - To calculate the Mean it's the sum(X)/Len(X)
      - To calculate the STD its the (Sum((X-Mean(x))^2)/len(X))^0.5
      - To calculate the Normalisation it's (X-Xmin)/(Xmax-Xmin) all values will fall between 0 and 1 after Normalisation
      - To calculate the Standardisation it's (X-Mean(X))/STD(X)
    
    * Step 5: Batch your X and Y
      - Batches are recommended if you have large datasets the size of the batch is usually a power of 2 e.g. (2,4,8,16,32...)
    
    * Step 6: Initalising a random Weight and Bias
      - A random Weight and Bias is initialised setting up the model which will use gradient descent to improve these two values
      - W is a Vector with shape Nx1 with N being the number of features
      - B is a Scalar

    * Step 7: Predict Å¶ using X
      - Work out your predicted y
      - This is done

Amount of Data Scraped
----------------------

* 560 cities have been scraped
* Each city contains 12 years of weather data
* 4,568 rows per city
* 11 columns per city
* A total of 2,558,080 rows x 11 columns
